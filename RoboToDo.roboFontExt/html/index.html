<h1>RoboToDo</h1>

<p>RoboToDo is a RoboFont extension for managing To-Do items associated with a .ufo.</p>

<p>To-Dos can be added to individual glyphs, or to the entire font.</p>

<p>Click the To-Do toolbar in the font window to access all To-Dos in the font, or click on the To-Do menu in the glyph panel to manage To-Dos for the current glyph.</p>

<p>When the To-Do manager is open, click on the &ldquo;+&rdquo; to create a new To-Do. Double click on a To-Do to edit the To-Do text. Click the check box to complete a To-Do.</P>

<p>All data is stored in the .ufo font info and glyph info fields. RoBoTodo tries to keep its data seperate from anything that might already be entered in these fields.</p>
